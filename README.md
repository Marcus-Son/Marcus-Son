## About Me

Hi, I'm Son!  
I'm currently a **Masterâ€™s student in Data Science** at the University of Michigan, deeply passionate about data-driven discovery and intelligent automation.  
Previously, I worked at the **Industrial Artificial Intelligence Lab at SeoulTech** as undergraduate researcher, where I applied cutting-edge machine learning to real-world challenges.

My main focus areas are **data science** and **machine learning**â€”from building predictive models to uncovering meaningful patterns in complex datasets.  
I thrive on solving difficult problems, learning new tools, and collaborating with others who are equally passionate about technology and innovation.

I'm always ready to dive into new ideas, contribute to impactful projects, and keep pushing my boundaries as a data scientist.  
If you want to talk about machine learning, data science, or research, letâ€™s connect!
