## About Me

**Data-driven explorer building the future with machine learning and analytics.**

Hi, Iâ€™m Son!
Iâ€™m a Data Science Masterâ€™s student at the University of Michigan with a passion for data-driven discovery and intelligent automation.
Previously, I worked at SeoulTechâ€™s Industrial AI Lab, applying machine learning to real-world problems.

My main focus is on data science and machine learningâ€”from predictive modeling to pattern discovery in complex datasets.
I enjoy solving tough problems, learning new skills, and collaborating with others who love technology and innovation.

Letâ€™s connect if you want to talk about machine learning, data science, or research!
